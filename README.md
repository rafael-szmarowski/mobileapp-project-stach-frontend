Stach is a hairdresser booking mobile app using React Native for the Frontend and ExpressJS for the Backend.

It's a draft project resulting from a group work. Code is working but hasn't been factored and cleaned.

Getting Started

The frontend makes call to a remote database on Heroku, you can change the link if you want to use your own MongoDB Database.

If you want build your own database, you can use datas from the folder "stachBDDExport" and create a database named "stach" and import collections appointments, comments, shops and users.

You will need Expo to start the project with "expo start" command

You will need to change the Google Places Autocomplete API key by your own to make this feature work.

Good coding and have fun !
